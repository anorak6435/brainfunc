# Brainfunc

My 2022 try for a brainf*ck compiler!

## commands
\> move pointer left    + 1
\< move pointer right   - 1
\+ increment cell
\- decrement cell
\[ start loop
\] end loop
\. print char
!important: Make sure that along the way the program handles edge cases.

Make the code structured / fun / BIG!

test_examples.py for the automated testing of the language

inside of the examples folder there are programs bigger not to be tested.
